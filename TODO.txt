%{\bf Dissertation research}
%\\Used tools from tensor calculus to derive the Euler and Ideal MHD equations in a curved coordinate system
%subject to the assumption of conical invariance. Then developed a numerical method to solve the systems. \\
%\\{\bf Raspberry Pi Light Board}\\
%Developed C++ software to make a Raspberry Pi into a lighting control board for my high school\textquotesingle s auditorium,
%allowing presets to be saved and for the lights to be controlled wirelessly.\\
%\\{\bf R/C Plane Builds}\\
%Designed and built multiple remote controlled airplanes. Arduino, 3D printing, soldering.
